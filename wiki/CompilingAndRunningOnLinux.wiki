#summary How to compile and run the maze game on linux.

= Introduction =

Make sure you have opengl, openal,freeglut,freealut all installed and ready to go and a svn client.

= Details =

First check out the code (svn checkout http://themazegame.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ themazegame),
then switch to the root directory (cd themazegame): 
  * Create a new folder build or sumn in the root directory(mkdir build)
  * Change to the build directory (cd build)
  * Run cmake on the root directory(cmake ..). All build specific files should be put in your build directory now.
  * Compile the code (make)
  * Copy the compiled executable from build/src to the root directory so the executable has access to data files (cp src/themazegame ..).
  * Switch back to the root directory (cd ..).
  * Enjoy (./themazegame)
