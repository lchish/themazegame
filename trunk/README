BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Inside the root directory, whatever you called it.. such as "themazegame", create a directory
called build. Move to that directory and run "cmake .." This will generate a makefile.
Do not run cmake in the root directory as it will not work. Now while still in the build
directory, run "make". This will generate the executable. It is located in themazegame/
build/src/ and is called themazegame. You need to copy this to the root directory for it
to work properly, else textures will not load. 

Alternatively you can run mkscript.sh in the root directory which will do this automatically.
Then run ./themazegame to play.
